		During the course of the B.Tech 1St year we have been through very few projects. It has been full of joy and an opportunity to learn something other than the regular curriculum. It is a way through which we come across the mistakes and correct them on our own and find something extraordiary. These projects are a way to develop our interest towards the science and develop scientific approach.

	<p style = "font-family: Helvetica; ; font-size: 22px;">
		During the course of work on this project, it has been a marvellous time for me in exploring different devices and the working physics behind them. Working on this project has definitely proved to be an arise of enthusiasm in the field of <b> COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING</b>. Here I have been through 25 Different devices and their working principles.

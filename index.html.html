			My name is Aditya Rai. I am currently enrolled as 1st Yr B.TECH student of <b> Computer Science & Enginnering </b> at <b>IIT ROORKEE</b>. I chose this school as it has most preposions in its name so it can't be beat. My haunts lie in <b>KANPUR</b>.

			Writing articles is hard, but designing this is really a fun. So by designing this I was able to do both.</p>
		<p style = "font-family: Helvetica ; font-size: 22px">
			Nothing brings me more pleasure than designing of web pages and their functioning. I sometimes think that I am made for it. 
			Apart from this I am vividly interested in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence though I have just been through the working principles of it & in future times I would definitely indulge myself in the field of ML & AI.

		<p style = "font-family: Helvetica ; font-size: 22px;">
			I'd like to think that I'm a very happy person, but I find the art that strikes me the truest is the sad, deprssing sort,I love music by <b>DANIEL LEVI</b>, post apolyptic fiction and movie trailers that can make me squirt tears in two minutes. GO FIGURE.<br><br><br>
